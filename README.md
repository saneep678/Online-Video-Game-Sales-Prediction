# Online-Video-Game-Sales-Prediction

This project focuses on leveraging data analytics and machine learning to predict
video game sales. By analyzing key factors such as historical sales data, market
trends, player demographics, and external influences, this project aims to provide

inventory effectively. These data-driven insights not only offer a competitive
advantage but also enable companies to allocate resources efficiently, reduce risks,
and ultimately boost profitability.
